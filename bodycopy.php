							<p>Dear Molloy Community:</p>
							<p>I am writing today to help you plan for on-campus interviews of the candidates in the search for the Dean of Arts & Sciences.</p>
							<p>The committee interviewed candidates for two days last week, and selected three finalists, and confirmed their on-campus interviews over the next two weeks. The dates are as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Candidate “A”:  Wednesday, April 25, 2018</li>
								<li>Candidate “B”:  Thursday, April 26</li>
								<li>Candidate “C”:  Monday, April 30</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<p>We do not yet have a set schedule for each day, but we are planning to have each candidate on campus for one and a half days.  The agenda for each visit will be posted to the website as soon as everything is confirmed.</p>
							<p>We will post the CV’s of each candidate 24 hours in advance of their arrival to campus, and the materials will be available through the committee website.  You all will be provided an opportunity to give your feedback on each candidate when they have completed their time on campus.</p>
							<p>I am looking forward to your participation!</p>
							<p>Sincerely,</p>
